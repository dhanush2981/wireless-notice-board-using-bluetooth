# wireless-notice-board-using-bluetooth

In this project I am going to demonstrate how to control LCD 16x2 using your smart phone with the help of Bluetooth connectivity 
This project will involve using a little a bit of code and a very simple circuit thatâ€™s great for beginners. 
This project aims to control the LCD using wireless technology. This will serve as a base to build more amazing projects on home automation and many more automation projects. 
The notice board is used to update peoples with new information or 
If you want to send message with in room or in hall but are not want to talk loudly then this project will help you. 
The project based on HC-05 Bluetooth module which Controlling16x2 LCD display. 
You can turn on or off the LCD display via smartphone and also you can send the text message. 

The LCD have been powered by Arduino UNO (Board). It contains a code which uploaded to the board. And once it simulated you can connect with Bluetooth Module (HC-05) with you compatible device 
Once code have been uploaded and Connected the Bluetooth and start Sending Command through app known as ArduinoBluetoothControl and start Sending Command you will be able to see that the desire Command which have been sent through app start's displaying on LCD. 
There is multiple Use of Project:- 
You can came to know how to use Bluetooth with Arduino. 
It is a very helpful project who are getting starting in home automation. 

If you want to send message with in room or in hall but are not want to talk loudly then this project will help you.
